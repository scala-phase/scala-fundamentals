# Databricks notebooks

This directory contains source notebooks for Scala Fundamentals,
suitable for import into [Databricks Community Edition](http://databricks.com/ce).

Note that some of the notebooks contain some metadata that is designed to be
parsed by a Databricks Education tool, to split the notebooks into "exercise
notebooks" and "solution notebooks". If you import those notebooks, you'll get
both exercises _and_ solutions (which is fine).
